# In this repo i am creating the templates for using docker compose on your local machine, feel free to download these and use freely.

# why docker-compose?
1. As you are aware we tend to install a lot of softwares on our machine for local development, Instead we can use docker to our leverage and keep out laptop clean.
2. this help us keep the development environment consistant across the team, so no more "works on my machine" things.
3. faster and easier mean to setup the env
4. code managed thing, so nothing can miss out.

# Step to use this thing:
 1. goto https://docs.docker.com/desktop/
 2. install appropriate version the one and only software you need for setup
 3. verify that this is working
 4. download docker compose into a folder
```
